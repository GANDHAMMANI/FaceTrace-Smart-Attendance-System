# FaceTrace-Smart-Attendance-System

## Overview
The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is a user-friendly application developed using Flask and the `face_recognition` library. This system allows a designated user (leader) to securely log in, capture student attendance through facial recognition, and monitor attendance percentages.

The project has been implemented in two versions:
1. Using an Excel file to store attendance records.
2. Using SQLite to manage attendance data in a database.

## Features
- **Secure Login:** Only authorized users can access the system with login credentials.
- **Facial Recognition:** Attendance is marked by scanning student faces using the camera.
- **Subject Selection:** The user can select a specific subject before taking attendance.
- **Attendance Records:** Attendance data is stored and organized for analysis.
  - Version 1: Data stored in an Excel file.
  - Version 2: Data managed in an SQLite database.
- **Attendance Percentage:** Admins can view students' attendance percentages.
